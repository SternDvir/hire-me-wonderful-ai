Payments marks an important milestone in our product evolution towards monetisation. \n\nIbu Ance is one of our very first merchants and has been using BukuWarung for almost a year. Her business has grown by several times over as she has benefited immensely from using our app due to improved cashflow visibility & efficient credit management. During Covid, it became essential for merchants like Ibu Ance to do contactless payments. There’s 60M micro-merchants in Indonesia and over 600B of GDP flows through them, mostly in cash. Opportunity to digitise these payments is massive.\n\nWe're hiring for key roles in product, design, engineering (android/backend) - come join us in helping Indonesian MSMEs go digital.\n\nVinnie Lauria Abhinay Peddisetty Adjie Purbojati",

He oversaw the scaling up of both the Product, Design and Engineering teams, bringing top-notch people to lead these teams. He is as I remember him from Grab, a very smart product-oriented technical person. He is thoughtful, equally challenging in his questions to his leaders but also deeply empathetic to all who work with him. He is also decisive, can cut through the noise and provide clear direction.",

Ive also been honored to try and return the favour as he set on his startup course - not that he has needed it at all. Smart, sharp, dependable I know success is around the corner for his latest venture. ",

His ability to sense the potential of a product/feature across verticals is what makes him phenomenal in the role of someone leading Product at scale.  Over my interaction and time spent working together, I found him to be metric driven and good at envisaging scope in the best interest of the company. He has a penchant for outdoing expectations and in true essence has a “Product-First” mindset. As a manager, Chinmay is supportive and visionary.

      "description": "I have worked closely with Thura on many Google projects for Myanmar over two years. Thura is one of the most dedicated, collaborative and creative professionals that I have had the pleasure of working with. Thura has been a stellar addition to our team, contributing a unique combination of skills in technical implementation, users’ understanding and business strategy. \n \nDuring his time with Google, Thura has touched upon virtually all Google products for Myanmar from Virtual keyboard, Handwriting, Android in Burmese to Gmail and Android One. For many of these products, he is involved in everything from conception, design to the actual implementation and launch.  It's very rare to find someone who is excellent at understanding how to improve business and products but at the same time, go back to his desk and actually develop the solution.\n \nThura is one of the most creative and resourceful people I know. We have been lucky to benefit from his enthusiastic participation on our team. It was very difficult to see him leave the organization. I highly recommend Thura for any endeavor he pursues. \n",

He joined our team to launch and optimize Google products for Myanmar, and being the first Googler on ground he serves as eyes, ears and voice of Google his home country. Thura has contributed a great deal to improve internet access in Myanmar during his first 12 months at the company, and I have no doubt that he will continue to be of great value to Google and his local community in the future. His extensive knowledge of IT and software development are a great asset for any company and I therefore highly recommend working with Thura.",

I’ve led and scaled teams of 100+ engineers across multiple regions, driving impactful solutions at scale.\n\nI excel at giving strategic direction to engineering teams, ensuring alignment with business goals while maintaining technical excellence. At the same time, I’m not one to shy away from getting hands-on when needed. I dive deep into the details to understand the root cause of problems and ensure we’re solving the right issues.\n\nMy passion lies in distributed systems and tackling system bottlenecks, always entrusted with solving my organization’s most challenging technical problems. I have a pragmatic mindset, constantly weighing trade-offs to find the most effective and scalable solutions.\n\nAs a bar raiser, I don’t just improve teams, I transform organizations. Whether it's optimizing processes, elevating engineering culture, or driving innovation, my track record and strong recommendations from past managers reflect my ability to deliver lasting impact.\n\nI operate with a high sense of ownership. Once I commit to something, I go the extra mile to ensure it gets done.",

Erwin's technical engineering skills were exceptional, and his contributions to our organization were invaluable.\n\nAs my manager, Erwin was an excellent mentor who was always willing to provide guidance and support. His vast technical knowledge and expertise were evident in his ability to quickly analyze complex problems and provide effective solutions. Erwin was also a great listener who encouraged open communication and constructive feedback to help us achieve our goals.\n\nduring that time, Erwin and I worked together on migrating multiple legacy services to microservices architecture. Utilizing Spring Boot, Postgres, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and ClickHouse, we were able to effectively scale a considerable number of services to handle a high volume of transactions per second. Moreover, we successfully delivered these services with minimal issues on production using canary deployment.\n\nErwin's technical engineering skills and leadership abilities were crucial in driving our organization's success, and I have no doubt that he will continue to excel anywhere he goes. I highly recommend Erwin to anyone seeking a skilled and competent leader with exceptional technical engineering skills.",

During my time at MOKA as a fresh graduate software engineer, he provided numerous opportunities for me to develop my skills.

During our one-on-one meetings, he provided valuable feedback and advice in a constructive manner. I highly recommend him if you're looking for the best team manager.",

His deep expertise in distributed computing, fault tolerance, and scalability set a high technical standard for our team, and he always guided us in designing architectures that were not only robust but also future-proof.\n\nBeyond his technical skills, Raz is an outstanding mentor. As a former educator, he has a rare level of patience when it comes to explaining complex concepts, and he never treats any question as too basic. He genuinely cares that his engineers understand the solutions they implement, and he constantly pushes us to grow—encouraging us to learn new technologies, refine our skills, and expand our problem-solving capabilities.\n\nRaz is also an exceptional team builder. During the hiring process, he knows how to attract top engineering talent, making candidates excited about joining us rather than a competitor. Once on board, he creates an environment where collaboration and motivation thrive. He understands that engineers perform best when challenged, so he regularly introduces opportunities for innovation—whether through new technologies, proof-of-concepts, or ambitious technical goals.\n\nPersonally, I learned a great deal from Raz—not just as an engineer, but also as a leader. His approach to mentorship, problem-solving, and team management has shaped the way I think about engineering leadership. That said, I’d like to think our learning went both ways. There were moments when I was able to offer a fresh perspective or share insights that Raz found valuable, which speaks to his open-mindedness and willingness to learn from anyone, regardless of title or experience level.\n\nWorking with Raz has been a career-defining experience. His combination of technical mastery, mentorship, and leadership makes him an invaluable asset to any engineering organization. Any team would be lucky to have him at the helm.",
