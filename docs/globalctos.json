  "about": "Accomplished Engineering Leader with track record of taking R&D site from scratch to and through successful acquisition.\n\nJan is Maths and Physics graduate turned into Software Engineer with various technologies and platforms, skilled Software Architect and Analyst, turned into Director of Engineering. Jan enjoys not only solving problems, but also getting to the very bottom of them, deeply understanding the processes as well as the motivations behind.\n\nJan started programming at the age of 9, developing system utilities in 8086 Assembler. Later, he was consumed by digital art and demoscene.  The love for visualization led to creation of Rthree, a powerful scientific visualization tool, used world-wide in mostly academic circles.\n\nIn his post-university career, Jan developed high volume cloud-deployed engagement apps (stand-alone widgets and Facebook apps) for Webtrends as a full-stack software engineer, was leading the development of a large-scale oriented CMS platform and founded DocFillet, a Virtual Data Room solution.\n\nIn 2014, Jan co-founded ambitious enterprise-oriented start-up Sapho as a Lead Front-End Engineer. He founded Sapho's R&D office in Prague, Czech Republic, and took it from 1 to 70 people, overseeing Research and Development. His mission was to help to bring a whole new approach into employees' data consumption and mundane tasks automatization. Sapho was acquired by Citrix Systems in November 2018 for more than $200M. Jan oversaw the integration of start-up team into the corporate structures and also integration of the Sapho technology into Citrix Workspace Intelligence.\n\nJan has co-authored several patented technologies around consolidated identity, detecting changes in large data-sets and related technologies.",

      "summary": "Abstract: This thesis focuses on two-dimensional computational simulations of flows of two immiscible incompressible viscous fluids with surface tension, while fixed computation grid is used. Free interface between fluids is realized by the level-set method that is suitable to capture changes in the interface topology. The flow is described by the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids, numerical discretization is done by finite elements method with Q2 - P1 elements, while whole problem is solved as coupled. Several example simulations are presented, an overview of numerical examples and analysis results related to this topic is also provided. ",

      "description": "A monitoring module interfaces with existing non-retrospective data storage systems, thus providing mechanisms for detecting and reporting changes in data values stored in such systems. The monitoring module acts as a change detection layer that can operate in connection with multiple disparate systems and/or locations, so as to provide users with a unified view into data stored in such systems. For example, a user can consult a single app, website, or software application, to view changes for data values stored in multiple disparate systems and/or locations; the app can be configured to automatically generate notifications and alerts to users, and can provide the ability to respond to such notifications and alerts, take actions, and/or dive deeper into underlying data.",

She will quickly pick up feedback and come up with resolutions. She has a sharp eye for design and is both able to decide its direction and not afraid to create a fully clickable mockup when necessary. She speaks the language of developers and is therefore very effective in communicating her ideas to them and quickly resolving any issues in a pragmatic way.\nAs a person she’s the starlight of the office, always happy to have a quick chat, and emotionally very resilient. She’s honest and open and will not bring problems but preferably solutions. I can highly recommend Joyce to pull the strategy of any user-facing product and streamline the communication to development teams.",

  "about": "I've been working in AI since before it became mainstream, driven by a childhood dream of creating inventions that could improve millions of lives. This led me to co-found Horus Technology in 2014, an AI company dedicated to enhancing the lives of nearly 300 million people who are blind or visually impaired. After successfully developing and scaling the technology, I led the company to a successful exit in 2019.\n\nFollowing Horus, I led product development at Caricami (https://www.caricami.it). Currently, I serve as CTO at a Los Angeles-based startup studio operating in stealth mode, where I've helped launch over 20 ventures spanning SaaS, AI, and B2B/B2C products in a fully remote environment. I also provide consulting CTO and Mobile Development services to select companies.\n\nI hold a MSc in Advanced Robotics and a BSc in Biomedical Engineering, with research experience at prestigious institutions including EPFL, IIT (Italy), and Ecole Centrale de Nantes. I'm also a proud alumnus of ISICT, the excellence school at the University of Genova, where I complemented my technical expertise with studies in management, economics, and law.",

      "source": "Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, SciTePress",
      "summary": "Reliable distance estimation of objects in a visual scene is essential for any artificial vision system designed to serve as the main sensing unit on robotic platforms. This paper describes a vision-centric framework for a mobile robot which makes use of bio-inspired techniques to solve visual tasks, in particular to estimate disparity. Such framework features robustness to noise, high speed in data processing, good performance in 3D reconstruction, the possibility to orientate the cameras independently and it requires no explicit estimation of the extrinsic parameters of the cameras. These features permit navigation with obstacle avoidance allowing active exploration of the scene. Furthermore, the modular design allows the integration of new modules with more advanced functionalities.",

      "source": "Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechnobiology",
      "summary": "Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involvement in pressure ulcers (PU) progression via a surge of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses is well documented. IRI strongly depends on the mechanical loading history. We present a generalized IRI model considering external loading, dynamic tissue healing capacity, accumulating mechanical and reperfusion-mediated damages and competing repair processes of saturating nature. Reperfusion depends on strain and strain rate to enhance loading history sensitivity. Tissue-specific ulceration susceptibility is assumed dependent on variable accumulated damage. We study damage evolution under cyclic loading having several strain expulsion profiles and demonstrate load relief history has critical impact on PU progression. Abrupt load removal generally follows existing models representing extreme repair/damage. We show (first time in silico) that under certain conditions (previously experimentally identified), IRI becomes repairing rather than damaging. In particular, we recapitulate the preconditioning and postconditioning IRI hallmarks. Finally, it is customary among physicians and nurses to promptly alleviate mechanical load applied to patients lying in bed for extended periods and in risk of developing PUs. We demonstrate this practice can be harmful. If load removal is performed early while reperfusion is still beneficial, then this conduct is suitable. However, if critical tissue damage has been crossed, then abrupt expulsion can constitute the worst-case scenario for patient outcome. If no preliminary patient documentation is available, we recommend gradual load removal since risks of accelerated damage eventually leading to ulceration supersede the improved repair potential benefit.",

      "source": "19th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing (IWSSIP)",
      "summary": "Shadow detection is a well-known problem in image and video processing. Detecting moving shadows is useful in numerous applications such as object detection and tracking. Most works in this area are not suitable for shadow detection using a low-cost outdoor surveillance camera. In this work we suggest a fast shadow detection approach for video surveillance, by comparing each video frame to a continuously updated background image. We differentiate shadow areas from foreground areas by assuming the shadow pixels are associated with background pixels through a nonlinear tone mapping. This assumption is general and applies to various systems and scene conditions. A distance measure between patch images that account for nonlinear tone mapping is calculated by adapting a recently suggested approach for pattern matching termed Matching by Tone Mapping (MTM). We show that the proposed technique is computationally efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art shadow detection techniques in typical surveillance scenarios.",

      "source": "Nature Materials",
      "summary": "Coherent Diffractive Imaging (CDI) is an algorithmic imaging technique where intricate features are reconstructed from measurements of the freely diffracting intensity pattern. An important goal of such lensless imaging methods is to study the structure of molecules that cannot be crystallized. Ideally, one would want to perform CDI at the highest achievable spatial resolution and in a single-shot measurement such that it could be applied to imaging of ultrafast events. However, the resolution of current CDI techniques is limited by the diffraction limit, hence they cannot resolve features smaller than one half the wavelength of the illuminating light. Here, we present sparsity-based single-shot subwavelength resolution CDI: algorithmic reconstruction of subwavelength features from far-field intensity patterns, at a resolution several times better than the diffraction limit. This work paves the way for subwavelength CDI at ultrafast rates, and it can considerably improve the CDI resolution with X-ray free-electron lasers and high harmonics.",

Our technique works in real-time, requires no scanning, and can be implemented in all existing microscopes - optical and non-optical. ",
