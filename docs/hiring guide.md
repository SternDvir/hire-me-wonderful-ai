**Hiring a Local CTO** 

\
Dear country managers, global team,

\
Each site should operate as a standalone high-tech startup, with CMs as CEOs, and as a high-tech startup, the site should also have a CTO, with a title like - “CTO Greece at Wonderful”.

The site CTO must be the undisputed technical leader from day one, fully hands-on, owning every aspect of implementation. As the site scales its customer base, the CTO will build and lead high-performing teams, hiring both individual contributors and technical leaders to support growth.

**Some of the CTO’s responsibilities include:**

- Lead the Technical Side of the Sales Process (then hire Pre-Sales eng, Solution Archs)
  - Demo the product and articulate our long-term vision
  - Present our AI Architecture, Cloud infra, Deployment options
  - Explain our Security & Privacy approach, including Compliance, Certifications (SOC2, GDPR, PCI,…)
  - Deep-dive into why our solution is stable, compatible, scalable, and easy to integrate with
  - Sell our differentiators (voice capabilities, agentic platform, integration and implementation approach)
  - Address concerns and overcome objections, be the smartest guy in the room
- Lead Software Engineering in the site
  - Be the face of Wonderful engineering in the region, attract and hire top-tier talent
  - Consult customers on best integration practices and implement as needed
  - Integrate with customers’ API Gateways
  - Build reusable connectors to local CRMs, KMSes, etc
  - Develop new platform features to satisfy local customer needs
  - Create internal and back-office tools as needed to improve efficiency and execution speed
- Lead Agent Engineering in the site (hire and train 1st Agent Eng, then expand)
  - Work directly with customers to scope, build, and deploy AI agents
  - Write prompts, JS functions, test cases and transform knowledge bases
  - Run QA sessions and feedback loops with customers
  - Monitor and maintain agent accuracy and success rates in production
- Technology delivery (POCs, implementations and go-live of customers)
  - Own site-level delivery
  - Be obsessed with site’s delivery speed and overall customer success
  - Handle technical escalations (reduce dependency on HQ)
- Lead Product in the site (then hire a PM)
  - Run product sessions with customers, respond to feature requests
  - Ensure the site adopts the latest product features and best practices from HQ
  - Escalate relevant platform requests to the global product team
  - Act as PM for locally-developed features
  - Contribute to the company-wide Product Guild
- Be the technical point of contact for local partners (hyper-scalers, GTM partners)
- Represent the site in company-wide R&D and CTO guilds



**Local CTO - Why and Who [Meets Meeting]**

**Background**

Why must every site have a CTO from day one?

From day one, we assumed each site would need a CTO. But a few days ago, we felt why it’s absolutely critical to have one in place from the start.

We’re running a POC in Greece with a local Amazon-like business. During this POC, it became painfully clear just how many resources it takes to run one successfully. In Israel, we’ve probably done 50+ POCs and implementations. We have big teams, team leaders, and clear processes. For Greece, we tried to pull help from Israel—an integration engineer to lead the agent build, an IE team lead for platform access, customer success for meetings and project management, Rachel (our CoS) for setup, and an engineer to oversee the tech side.

But here’s the problem: nobody owned the project from the technical side. That’s the job of a full-time IM/IE, and in Greece, we didn’t have that—only Ilia, the GM (and soon-to-be CTO). The result? Funny mistakes in delivery (no need to elaborate).

It’s almost impossible to run local POCs using only HQ resources. A GM needs a CTO to own the technical delivery—first for POCs, and then for pre-sale technical meetings and beyond.

That’s the why. The other reason for this conversation is the who—we need to align on who could be a local CTO and who’s not a fit.

**Local CTO - Requirements for Hiring Managers**\


**Must haves:**

1. **Strong software engineering background\*** – at least 7-8 years of hands-on engineering (not frontend) experience.
1. **High EQ / Charisma / Energy / Inspiring\***
1. **Hands-On -** either in part of their current role, or as a hobby – they need to be super up-to-date with AI.
1. **Strong English skills** – written and spoken.

\*Personal growth over the years** - a validator for the first two rules – no personal growth usually means => not strong technically OR low-eq / charisma.	\
\
(Additionally, Wonderful’s baseline values are: Urgency, Professionalism, Independency and Vibe – we expect a critical hire like a Local CTO to excel in all four)

**Bonus**:

- **Customer-facing background** – has already moved into roles like Solution Architect, Field CTO, or Deployed Engineer
- **Proven leadership** – people who’ve been Directors, VPs, etc
- **Startup background** — Worked at a Product company, ideally as a founding team member

\


**The Local CTO would need to:**

- hold meetings from a One-on-One with the local CTO of AWS in their country, to a technical meeting with 30 enterprise architects in the same room.
- be the smartest guy in the room & be someone who can talk with charisma and high levels of energy about what we do.
- be a versatile zero-to-one operator – can own pre-sales, solution architecture, coding, prompt engineering, hiring, team-building, and product understanding. 
- do it all in the first few months, then hire strong people and delegate.

**Start by looking for:**

- Ex CTOs / VP Engs of local startups
